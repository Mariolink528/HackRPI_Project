        <p> 
            By pushing past our boundaries in space exploration, 
            we are able to question the theories that we believe 
            are true and find answers to questions we don’t know: 
            Can we apply the fundamental theories that work on Earth 
            on other planets? Are we alone in this universe? 
            The latter is a question that has pondered scientists 
            for years and when water was found on Mars, the 
            possibility of finding another intelligent species 
            like us increased significantly. Until now, this species 
            has yet to be discovered but with the advancement of 
            technology, we will be able to locate more Earth-like planets 
            and one day visit them in-person.

            In addition to expanding our knowledge on the universe, 
            space exploration serves as a way for countries all over 
            the world to combine resources and work together. Over the 
            years, countries improved space equipment and sent out probes 
            and spacecrafts to collect data on the celestial bodies within 
            our solar system. As global warming becomes an increasingly 
            pressing issue, the images and temperature measurements 
            collected from telescopes and probes can be used to urge 
            world leaders into taking more steps to reduce the numerous 
            amounts of greenhouse gasses being emitted into the atmosphere. 
            And if that doesn’t sound important to you, space exploration 
            also creates tons of jobs. NASA alone supports nearly 340,000 
            jobs nationwide. Imagine how many jobs space companies support 
            altogether!
